- Introduce stb_image
- Load a texture with stbi_load
- Create texture staging buffer
    - usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT
    - Allocate and bind memory: type = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
    - Copy image pixels to that buffer
- Create an image for the texture
    - Relation between image and buffer
    - Allocate and bind memory for the image: type = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT
        - Fast gpu memory, not accessible from cpu. Have to copy to it through a staging buffer that is host-visible.
- Create a command buffer and begin it with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT usage flag
- Record the buffer:
    - transition image layout (vkCmdPipelineBarrier): VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED -> VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL
    - vkCmdCopyBufferToImage from staging buffer to the image
    - transition image layout (vkCmdPipelineBarrier): VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL -> VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL
- Submit the command buffer to graphics queue
- Wait until the graphics queue is idle, for easy synchronization
    - At this point the pixels have been copied from the staging buffer to the image and the layout is optimal for the shader to sample it
- Create an image view for the image
