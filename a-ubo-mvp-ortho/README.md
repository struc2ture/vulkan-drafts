- Introduce lin_math. Just m4 and identity.
- Create buffer for the uniform. Similar to vertex buffer, but with usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT
- Upload identity matrix to the uniform buffer
- Create descriptor set layout
- Create descriptor pool
- Allocate descriptor sets
- Update descriptor sets to point to the uniform buffer
- Move the code to create_basically_everything, so it gets rebuilt with the swapchain
    - Not necessary, but just to simplify the sequence, as it will be used when creating the pipeline, which gets recreated with the swapchain
- Specify the descriptor set layout in pSetLayouts in the pipeline layout
- Bind the descriptor set in the command buffer every frame, when command buffer is recorded
- Specify the UBO in the shader, with set = 0, binding = 0, and use it for MVP
- Test by passing a 2x scale into the mvp ubo, instead of identity
- Introduce the ortho projection function
- Modify the triangle verts to be in screen space
