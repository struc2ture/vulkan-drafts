- Hardcoded light and phong calculations in shader. Normals
- Use UBO for proj_view matrix. Model in push constant separately.
- Apply model without translation to normals. Calculate frag world pos for diffuse lighting
- Extend UBO to take a struct of view_proj matrix and the view pos needed for specular lighting
    - Because UBO is used from both vertex and fragment shader, update stageFlags = VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT | VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT for descriptor set layout bindings.
- Unhardcode lighting parameters, by using UBO
