- Introduce stb_image
- Load a texture with stbi_load
- Create texture staging buffer
    - usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT
    - Allocate and bind memory: type = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
    - Copy image pixels to that buffer
- Create an image for the texture
    - Relation between image and buffer
    - Allocate and bind memory for the image: type = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT
        - Fast gpu memory, not accessible from cpu. Have to copy to it through a staging buffer that is host-visible.
- Create a command buffer and begin it with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT usage flag
- Record the buffer:
    - transition image layout (vkCmdPipelineBarrier): VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED -> VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL
    - vkCmdCopyBufferToImage from staging buffer to the image
    - transition image layout (vkCmdPipelineBarrier): VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL -> VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL
- Submit the command buffer to graphics queue
- Wait until the graphics queue is idle, for easy synchronization
    - At this point the pixels have been copied from the staging buffer to the image and the layout is optimal for the shader to sample it
- Create an image view for the image
- Create a sampler
- Rectify the descriptor set layout creation:
    - One new binding for the sampler, in the same descriptor set layout.
    - Include one more pool size in descriptor pool, one for the ubo, one for sampler. Still the same pool, just bigger
    - Still allocate the one descriptor set, but now it includes two bindings in its layout
    - vkUpdateDescriptorSets: Binding 0 -- UBO; binding 1 -- texture sampler
- Move the texture loading code to create_basically_everything, because it's again a dependency of desriptor set layout and thus pipeline layout and thus pipeline. For now, it's the easiest, albeit the most brute-force way to do it. Without creating a complicated dependency tree. Will sort this out later.
- Update shaders, hardcoding UVs for now. Just check that it's sampling texture.
- Update shaders to take another vertex attribute: uvs. Unhardcode the uvs in the shader.
- Update vertex input attribute descriptions in the vertex input state when creating pipeline
- Flip png image in stb
- Change texture image format to VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM... for some reason... it was looking darker than original with SRGB... for some reason...
    - Still don't understand srgb....
