- Temporary create_basically_everything and destroy_basically_everything. No abstractions for now.
- destroy_basically_everything:
    - Destroy pipeline
    - Destroy pipeline layout
    - Destroy framebuffers
    - Destroy render pass
    - Destroy image view
    - Destroy swapchain
    - Destroy semaphores
        - Easiest way to "reset" them, as their signals might not have been consumed on a frame with suboptimal error
- create_basically_everything:
    - Query physical device capabilities and formats again
    - Get extent from capabilities
    - Re-create swapchain
    - Re-obtain swapchain images
    - Re-create image views
    - Re-create render pass
    - Re-create framebuffers
    - Re-create pipeline
        - Query GLFW for framebuffer size to be used for the pipeline viewport
    - Re-create semaphores
- vkAcquireNextImageKHR and vkQueuePresentKHR might return VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR (not an error) or VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR (full-on error).
    - In that case, set recreate_everything flag
    - continue, so the rest of rendering and logic that frame gets skipped
- In the beginning of each frame, check recreate_everything flag, if need to:
    - Wait until device is idle (vkDeviceWaitIdle)
    - destroy_basically_everything
    - create_basically_everything
- Enable window resizing in GLFW again
