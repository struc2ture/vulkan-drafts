- Define verts for a triangle (positions + colors)
- Create generic buffer (VkBufferCreateInfo, vkCreateBuffer --> VkBuffer) with usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT, sharing mode = VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, and specifying the inner/usable size for the data
- To allocate memory (VkMemoryAllocateInfo, vkAllocateMemory --> VkDeviceMemory), need to specify memory requirements (VkMemoryAllocateInfo) for the created VkBuffer, based on the device. allocationSize = memory_requirements.size
- Also for allocation need to find suitable memory type:
    - For physical device
    - Pick out of suitable memory types specified in the memory_requirements
    - Pick types that have flags: VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT
- Bind device memory (VkDeviceMemory) to buffer (VkBuffer)
- Upload data to device memory bound to the buffer:
    - Memory map with C pointer void *data
    - memcpy to the data
    - Unmap memory
