- Annotated vulkan state init
- VulkanBasicallyEverything state - make not global
- Introduce perspective projection lin math
- Incrementally switch over to perspective projection:
    - ortho quad -> no proj quad
    -> persepctive proj quad, set z = -5.0f in shader
    -> pass vec3 into shader for pos, set z in code
    -> mvp = perspective * translate to -5.0f
    -> cube verts: 8 verts, 36 indices
- Construct cube verts:
    - Check correct winding and tex-coord order
- Enable back face culling: VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo.cullMode = VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT, .frontFace = VK_FRONT_FACE_COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
- Depth buffer:
    - Create image and allocate and bind memory for it
    - Create image view
    - Update framebuffer to have 2 attachments: swapchain image and depth buffer
    - Update render pass to include depth attachment; and in subpass - attachment reference
    - Update command buffer recording to clear depth buffer when beginning render pass -- include another clear value
    - Enable depth test in pipeline: pass VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo in graphics_pipeline_create_info.pDepthStencilState
    - Check depth buffer (disable culling to check)
    - Destroy depth buffer image and view and free memoryon cleanup
- Camera:
    - Introduce some lin math: v3 functions, m4_look_at
    - Camera struct: pos, pitch, yaw
    - Get view matrix from camera struct using m4_look_at
    - Camera controls
    - No subpixel mouse position on macOS in GLFW, no raw mouse on macOS in GLFW either --> switch to orbiting the object for better demo
    - Don't set initial mvp when creating uniform buffer -- it's updated every frame now
    - Exponential mouse smoothing
