- Hardcoded light and phong calculations in shader. Normals
- Use UBO for proj_view matrix. Model in push constant separately.
- Apply model without translation to normals. Calculate frag world pos for diffuse lighting
- Extend UBO to take a struct of view_proj matrix and the view pos needed for specular lighting
