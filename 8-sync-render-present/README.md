- Create image available and render finished semaphores
- Semaphores are used for GPU-GPU sync; fences -- GPU-CPU sync
- In this case I only use semaphores - for GPU-GPU sync. No fences. And vkQueueWaitIdle on present/graphics queue so CPU waits for present being done, hence a vblank, hence input polling at consistent FPS.
- Every frame:
    - Acquire next swapchain image (vkAcquireNextImageKHR)
    - vkAcquireNextImageKHR will signal on the image available semaphore
    - After command buffer is re-recorded for the right image,
    - Submit command buffer to queue: VkSubmitInfo and vkQueueSubmit
        - GPU will wait on the image available semaphore before executing the command buffer
        - GPU will wait for that semaphore before rendering to color attachment by setting pWaitDstStageMask = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT
        - When submitted queue is finished executing, it will signal on render finished semaphore
    - Queue present: VkPresentInfoKHR and vkQueuePresentKHR
        - GPU will wait on the render finished semaphore before presenting
        - References swap chain Can present to multiple swapchains at once
    - CPU-wait until the present queue is idle -- vkQueueWaitIdle
- Added result checking to every vk call that returns VkResult
- Disabled window resizing because it causes VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR error when presenting -- need to rebuild swapchain for new window size
